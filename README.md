#Case Study 4

Company overview:

UniTrain co. provides office supplies to customers and they need a  sales overview report for the period 2019-2022 and Year-to-Date (YTD) sales for 2023.

Business Requirement:
- Create Sales Overview report
- DAX Calculation for Return Rate
- Show the top 5 customers with the highest revenue in each region

  File Descriptions:
  I used Power Query + Power Pivot to clean and create relationships between datasets. To create Sales Overview report, I used charts to show the total sales, sales per year and quarter for 2019-2022 to compare 2023 sales charts.
